# Project Instructions

In this project, we collected data related to **anaemia** in individuals. The main goal is to practice and improve my machine learning skills. Specifically, this project focuses on applying **GridSearchCV** to optimize model hyperparameters. If you're not familiar with GridSearchCV, you can learn more about it by visiting [this link](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html).

## Libraries Used

This project uses the following libraries:
- **numpy**: For numerical operations and array manipulations.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**:
  - **preprocessing**: For data preprocessing tasks.
  - **model_selection**: For splitting the data and performing hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- **SVC**: Support Vector Classifier algorithm for classification tasks.

## How to Install Libraries

To install the required libraries, use the following commands:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```
